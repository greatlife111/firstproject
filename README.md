# Project Name: DUE ALERT


- ***What will the application do?***

The alert application is used for viewing and sending reminders at

designated times. Information about the reminder can be entered

in the order of date, name of activity, due time, whether to send

a reminder, time of reminder. Features include checking all due alerts 

on a day by entering a date, entering name of activity and viewing the due

date, due time, and time of reminder (if any).



- ***Who will use it?***

The target will be students who need to keep track of deadlines

and important dates.

- ***Why is this project of interest to me?***

As someone who tend to forget about assignments and poor at 

time management myself, I've always wished that there is an 

academic based application that keeps track of all the important

dates that I have assignments due. There are applications with 

ample tools to set reminders, differentiate the type of reminders, etc. 

However, it can be overwhelming to look at all the events at once.

Thus, I want to create an application that is concise enough to store

all the reminder information and student-friendly.
