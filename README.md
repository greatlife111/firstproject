# Project Name: DUE ALERT


- ***What will the application do?***

The alert application is used for viewing alerts and sending reminders at designated times. Information about the 
reminder can be entered in the order of date, name of activity, due time, and how many times it will remind the user. 
Features include checking all alerts in various ways: on the day of, before a date, and before ___ days, adding and 
deleting alerts in your personal account, making changes to account and alert details, and having a notification list 
where you can check off reminders.



- ***Who will use it?***

The target will be students who need to keep track of deadlines and important dates.

- ***Why is this project of interest to me?***

As someone who tend to forget about assignments and poor at time management myself, I've always wished that there is an
academic based application that keeps track of all the important dates that I have assignments due. There are 
applications with ample tools to set reminders, differentiate the type of reminders, etc. However, it can be 
overwhelming to look at all the events at once. Thus, I want to create an application that is concise enough to store
all the reminder information and student-friendly.
